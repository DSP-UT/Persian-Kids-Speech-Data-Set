# Persian-Kids-Speech-Data-Set
The speech signals from 286 children (141 girls, 145 boys), ages 6 to 9-year-old, were recorded. This recorded data is manually checked and labeled. Finally, a corpus containing 162,395 samples with a duration of 33 hours and 44 minutes is created. The prepared speech corpus is particularly applicable to speech recognition and linguistics studies. It comprehensively contains all the 29 Persian phonemes, 118 syllables, 56 sub-words, and 711 words.
